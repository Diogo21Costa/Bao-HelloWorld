# "Hello world"? We prefer "Hello Bao!"

We encourage new users of the Bao hypervisor to join this tour on a practical tour using Bao. If you're already acquainted with Bao or want to deploy a specific setup already provided by our team, you can directly jump to the Bao demos page.

In this guide, we will take a tour of the different components required to build a setup using the Bao hypervisor and learn how the different components interact. For this purpose, the guide contains the following topics:

- A **getting started** to help users on preparing the environment to build the setup and also some pointers to documentations of Bao (in case you want to go deeper in any detail);

- An **initial setup** for giving the first steps on this tour. This section aims to explore the different components of the system and get the first practical example of this guide;

- An **interactive tutorial on changing the guests** running on top of Bao;

- A **practical example** of changing the setup running;

- An example of **how different guests can coexist and interact** with each other;
